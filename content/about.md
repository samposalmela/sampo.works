# What else?

## Dungeons and Dragon

In recent years my love for this TTRPG has grown as I have participated in games to spend time with friends and make new ones. I have also taken the mantle of Dungeon Master and I am creating my own worlds. I very much enjoy the process of bringing something of my own to "life" with D&D and I think this is the best creative outlet that I have ever had.

## Mechanical keyboards

I like to dabble in mechanical keyboards and I am a consumer of lot of content related to them. I have built few myself and attended Finnish mechanical keyboard community meetings.
