# About this site

This site will work as training ground myself to make me more motivated to work on different projects related to my work, hobbies and skills. 
# Working life

I currently work as cyber security developer and have history in cyber security and server administration. 

# What else?

## Gaming and everything related

I will mark this here even though I have rarely done nothing towards this yet. I have always loved video games and decided that game development would be nice middle ground for my technical knowledge, creative desires and love for gaming. 

I currently also play Dragons & Dungeons and have also worked as Dungeon Master for a while.

## Mechanical keyboards

I like to dabble in mechanical keyboards and I am a consumer of lot of content related to them. I have built few myself and attended Finnish mechanical keyboard community meetings.
