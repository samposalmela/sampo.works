      <description>About this site This site will work as training ground myself to make me more motivated to work on different projects related to my work, hobbies and skills.
Working life I currently work as cyber security developer and have history in cyber security and server administration.
What else? Dungeons and Dragon In recent years my love for this TTRPG has grown as I have participated in games to spend time with friends and make new ones.</description>
