      <description>About this site This site will work as training ground myself to make me more motivated to work on different projects related to my work, hobbies and skills.
Working life I currently work as cyber security developer and have history in cyber security and server administration.
What else? Gaming and everything related I will mark this here even though I have rarely done nothing towards this yet. I have always loved video games and decided that game development would be nice middle ground for my technical knowledge, creative desires and love for gaming.</description>
